# Using ROS 2 and AutoAPMS with PX4 Autopilot

This repository holds ROS 2 packages enabling behavior-based ROS 2 applications for the popular [PX4 Autopilot](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot) project. This implementation adopts the [AutoAPMS](https://github.com/robin-mueller/auto-apms) framework and introduces plenty of plugins making it easier than ever to communicate with PX4 from e.g. a companion computer running ROS 2.
